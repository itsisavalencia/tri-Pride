# Project Title
tri-Pride

## Overview

This app is for my local pride organization, tri-Pride. It will enhance their online presence and serve as a central hub for tracking the most up-to-date information on their history, board of directors, and events.

### Problem

tri-Pride previously had an outdated and non-functional website. With their recent rebranding and significant growth in 2022-2023, there was an urgent need for a modern, reliable website. Over the past year, tri-Prideâ€™s Board of Directors, volunteers, and partners have witnessed increased community attendance at events and heightened awareness, support, and presence within the Region of Waterloo. To reflect and support this growth, a new, dynamic website was essential to effectively communicate tri-Pride's mission and activities.
